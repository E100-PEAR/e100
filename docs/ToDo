Pressing escape from analysis takes us to the Main menu.
It would be nice if it took us back to the analysis menu instead.

Figure out bug that causes Tiger to move left.

Pointer isn't very well positioned for analysis and comparison
menus.  Fix it.

It would be nice if there was a replay button in playback and frame-
by-frame. Even less important, it would be cool if we could rewind.

Need to draw buttons on frame by frame screen.  Should only be one button
because there is no play or pause, just next frame.

Frame-by-frame would be better if it didn't change frames on button release
as well as button press
